# Space-Invaders
Space Invaders inspired PC game. 
I created an arcade-style game using the SDL libraries in C++.

###### The player can move the spaceship left and right using 'a' and 'd' keys respectively and shoot using spacebar.

With small alterations, the code can used as a game engine to create other similar games.
## Requirements
The C++ libraries required:
1. SDL_2 (https://www.libsdl.org/download-2.0.php)

2. SDL_image (https://www.libsdl.org/projects/SDL_image/)

3. SDL_TTF (https://www.libsdl.org/projects/SDL_ttf/)

The libraries are available for Mac OS X, Windows, and Linux.
